## SFDD
I have coined the term *Semi Functional Decomposition Diagram* as a modification on FDD </br>
These higher level FDDs show all of the relevant functions in regard to the program </br>
The difference here is that the *external entities* will sometimes not be external but other *functions* </br>
For Example: </br>
The interactions between **client** and **server** is a difficult to describe without describing it as an *external entity* </br>
